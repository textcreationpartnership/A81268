            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF Colonel Adam Murray, Humbly Repreſented to the COMMONS, in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Aſſembled.</head>
            <p>HE was among the firſt who declar'd, and took up Arms for Their Majeſties, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>When the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Popiſh Regiment was ſent to Garriſon, the Town of <hi>Derry,</hi> he was one of thoſe who roſe in the Country, forced them away, and thereby encourag'd the People of the Town to ſhut their Gates againſt them, and conſequently to hold out, as they afterwards did againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>Preſently after he raiſed a Troop, with which he gave all the oppoſition he could to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces at <hi>Claudyford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Proteſtants retreated from thence, 400 Horſe ſtuck by him, with which he continued nigh the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army ſome days after the Proteſtants fled into <hi>Derry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this when the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army ſurrounded all that part of <hi>Derry,</hi> which lay open from the Sea, the Proteſtants within the Town, ſent a Letter to him, to come ſpeedily in, otherwiſe that the Town would be loſt; for that Colonel <hi>Lundy</hi> was treating with <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> General about a Surrender.</p>
            <p>Upon this Meſſage he forc'd his way through the Enemies Dragoons, and got into the Town, but not without the loſs of ſeveral of his Men.</p>
            <p>When he came into the Town, he immediately went to Colonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> chief Commander, with a ſtrong body of Men: <hi>Lundy</hi> told him they had ſign'd to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render upon Honourable terms, and ſhewed him the Inſtrument they had ſign'd, upon which he proteſted againſt any Treaty with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army; which hinder'd the delivering up the Town at that time.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he march'd to the Main-Guard, and ſecur'd the Keys of all the Gates and Stores, which he kept for two Days, till it was agreed that Colonel <hi>Baker,</hi> a very ingenious Man and good Souldier, ſhould be Governour of the City, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſhould manage the Stores, and Colonel <hi>Murry</hi> ſhould Command the Horſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known what Service thoſe Horſe did, 'till, in extream neceſſity, they were by Order of Council, forc'd to Eat them.</p>
            <p>He was afterwards in all the frequent Sallies that were made, and was always ſucceſsful, till about Eight days before the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army fled from before <hi>Derry,</hi> he was Shot thro' the Body, as they purſued the Enemy to their Trenches.</p>
            <p>After he recover'd of his Wounds, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army were forc'd to quit the Siege, he continu'd a Reform'd Officer, according to the King's Letter to D. <hi>Schomberg, that the</hi> Derry <hi>Officers ſhou'd be continu'd in full Pay, till provided for in equal or better Poſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1691, General <hi>Ginkel</hi> ſent him from the Camp to the Lords Juſtices in <hi>Dubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> where he was intruſted with a very ample Commiſſion, to Command all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter.</hi> This Commiſſion he can ſhew, together with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Thanks, from General <hi>Ginkel,</hi> for the Service he did with the Militia; and particularly thoſe who were ſent to <hi>James Town</hi> and <hi>Sligo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was three Years and ſome Months Lieutenant Colonel to the Lord <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> till that Regiment was broke: The Pay then receiv'd, with a ſmall Sum, call'd <hi>Bounty-Money,</hi> and 20 <hi>l.</hi> from my Lord <hi>Conningsby,</hi> is all the Reward he has had for his Sufferings and Services; in mentioning which he thinks it not very decent, or modeſt to be too particular he refers to common Fame, and in one particular, to what the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army generally ſaid, that he kill'd the <hi>French</hi> General <hi>Mammoo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis very well known, what great Propoſals King <hi>James</hi> made him, firſt by the Earl of <hi>Abercorn,</hi> afterwards by his own Father (ſent unto him by the King) if he wou'd come over to him.</p>
            <p>He having no Eſtate has contracted conſiderable Debts, and his Family muſt be reduc'd to extream Miſery and Ruine, unleſs relieved by the Juſtice and Mercy of this Honourable Houſe.</p>
